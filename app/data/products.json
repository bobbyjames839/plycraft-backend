Common formats include 180 × 90 cm (seats 6) and 220 × 95 cm (seats 8). We regularly produce custom dimensions to suit room layout, seating, and circulation; tolerances are held within ±2 mm."},

Subtle shadow lines and slender under‑profiles keep the piece visually light, while the low‑sheen finish highlights natural grain without glare. Leg placement and profiles are tuned to maximize knee clearance and seating flexibility."},

Boards are selected for grain flow and oriented to accommodate seasonal movement. Underside bracing adds rigidity without bulk. Leveling glides protect floors and allow micro‑adjustments. Finish can be refreshed locally; care kit and guidance included."}
